# Database Integration & Architecture Prompt

## Role

You are an expert **Database Administrator (DBA)**, **Senior Principal Software Engineer**, **Solution Architect**, **Backend Engineer**, **DevOps Engineer**, and **Security Expert**.

Your responsibility is to analyze the entire application and integrate a production-ready relational database architecture without breaking any existing functionality.

---

# Objective

Perform a complete end-to-end migration of the application from JSON/mock data to a fully normalized **Neon PostgreSQL** relational database while keeping the application compatible with:

- React Frontend
- Express.js Backend
- Node.js
- Render Hosting
- Neon PostgreSQL

The application must remain production-ready, scalable, secure, and maintainable.

---

# Initial Analysis

Before writing any code, perform a complete analysis of the repository.

Analyze:

- Entire project folder structure
- React application
- Express server
- API routes
- Controllers
- Services
- Middleware
- Models
- Utility files
- Environment variables
- Authentication
- Authorization
- JSON mock data
- Static data
- Assets
- Existing business logic
- Existing validations
- API contracts
- State management
- Application workflows
- Error handling
- Logging
- Deployment configuration

Do **not** assume anything.

Understand how every feature currently works.

---

# JSON Data Analysis

Locate every JSON file used as mock data.

Analyze:

- Data structure
- Relationships
- Nested objects
- Arrays
- Duplicate data
- IDs
- Missing IDs
- Foreign key relationships
- Enumerations
- Nullable values
- Data types
- Validation rules
- Lookup tables
- Derived values

Create an optimal relational model.

---

# Database Design

Design a fully normalized PostgreSQL database.

Requirements:

- Third Normal Form (3NF)
- Prefer BCNF where appropriate
- Eliminate duplicate data
- Correct relationships
- Proper indexing
- Proper constraints
- Primary Keys
- Foreign Keys
- Unique Constraints
- Check Constraints
- Composite Keys where needed
- Lookup tables
- Junction tables
- Audit columns
- Versioning where appropriate

Every table should include appropriate metadata such as:

- created_at
- updated_at
- deleted_at (soft delete if applicable)
- created_by
- updated_by

---

# Database Standards

Use PostgreSQL best practices.

Choose proper data types:

- UUID
- TEXT
- VARCHAR
- BOOLEAN
- INTEGER
- BIGINT
- NUMERIC
- JSONB only when justified
- DATE
- TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE

Avoid anti-patterns.

---

# Neon PostgreSQL

Configure the application for Neon PostgreSQL.

Include:

- Connection pooling
- SSL
- Environment variables
- Production configuration
- Local development configuration
- Connection retry
- Health checks
- Proper timeout settings

Never hardcode credentials.

Use `.env`.

---

# ORM / Query Layer

Choose the most suitable ORM or query builder for this project.

Evaluate:

- Prisma
- Drizzle ORM
- Knex
- Raw PostgreSQL

Explain why the chosen solution is the best fit.

Implement:

- Database client
- Models
- Repository layer
- Query layer
- Transactions
- Migrations
- Seed scripts

---

# Data Migration

Create a complete migration strategy.

Convert all existing JSON mock data into SQL data.

Generate:

- Seed scripts
- Import scripts
- Data validation
- Duplicate detection
- Relationship mapping
- Transaction-safe imports

Migration must be repeatable.

---

# Backend Refactoring

Replace every mock JSON read/write operation.

Convert all endpoints to database operations.

Replace:

- File reads
- File writes
- In-memory arrays
- Temporary storage

with proper SQL operations.

Maintain existing API contracts.

Do not introduce breaking changes.

---

# API Validation

Ensure all APIs continue to work.

Review:

- GET
- POST
- PUT
- PATCH
- DELETE

Validate:

- Request payloads
- Response payloads
- Status codes
- Error messages
- Pagination
- Filtering
- Searching
- Sorting

---

# Transactions

Use database transactions where required.

Examples:

- Multi-table inserts
- Updates
- Deletes
- Rollbacks

Prevent partial writes.

---

# Performance

Optimize the database.

Include:

- Index strategy
- Query optimization
- Execution plans
- Avoid N+1 queries
- Batch operations
- Efficient joins
- Pagination
- Lazy loading where appropriate

---

# Security

Implement database security.

Include:

- SQL injection prevention
- Parameterized queries
- Input validation
- Output sanitization
- Principle of least privilege
- Secure environment variables
- Secret management

---

# Authentication

Review existing authentication.

Integrate users with PostgreSQL.

Store:

- Users
- Roles
- Permissions
- Sessions (if applicable)

Passwords must be securely hashed.

---

# Authorization

Review all authorization logic.

Move permission checks into a maintainable structure.

Implement:

- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Permission mapping
- Database-driven authorization where appropriate

---

# Error Handling

Improve database error handling.

Handle:

- Constraint violations
- Duplicate keys
- Missing records
- Deadlocks
- Timeouts
- Connection failures
- Validation failures

Return meaningful API errors.

---

# Logging

Implement structured logging for:

- Queries (development only)
- Errors
- Slow queries
- Connection issues
- Migration failures

Avoid logging secrets.

---

# Configuration

Update:

- Environment variables
- Database configuration
- Render deployment
- Neon connection
- Build scripts
- Startup scripts

---

# Testing

Update all tests.

Include:

- Unit tests
